This repository contains some of the code from school work I did in my Mechanical/Digital Engineering course work. I learned a variety of languages including Java, Python, Matlab, CSS, HTML.

## Projects
- ENME 473 Matlab code. This code plots the movement path of a point on a assembly of bars for my Kinematics class
- First year eng final coding prject: Made a interactive visualization of weather data in processing from scratch.
- ENSF 310 Final Project: A python class me and my partner Julien Lagace made for the final project of the class. Tested and ran through the Jupyter notebook which also give the project some context. The class has the ability to pull and display real historical and current stock data using the yfinance library and plotting it using plotly.
